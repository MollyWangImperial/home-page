# Rehyn instruction voice cloning

Rehyn can use a private voice reference for assessment and exercise instructions. Alira chat, emergency speech, and dynamic movement feedback keep the existing OpenAI voice. The cloned instruction endpoint only accepts app-authored rehabilitation guidance, so it cannot be used to make the clone say arbitrary text.

## Alira's one voice (ElevenLabs, every spoken line)

Set `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_SCOPE=all` (already in `render.yaml`) to make one designed ElevenLabs voice speak as Alira everywhere: assessment and exercise instructions, corrections, feedback, celebrations and chat replies. It needs `INSTRUCTION_TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs`. Alira's voice ID is built in (`ALIRA_ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`, the same as `shared/alira-voice.ts` in the recovery companion), so `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` only needs setting to try a different voice; `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` must come from the ElevenLabs workspace that owns the voice (Molly's Workspace); the delivery settings in `ALIRA_VOICE_SETTINGS` (`backend/server.py`) mirror that file, so change them in both places together.

This scope is for a designed or stock voice only. A cloned voice of a real person must stay on the default scope (`instruction`), which keeps it to app-authored guidance. Before deploying with `all`, check that `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` on Render is Alira's voice and not a clone.

Fixed lines are recorded once and committed, so they cost nothing to replay:

```powershell
$env:ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "your-key"
$env:ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID = "alira-voice-id"
python -m backend.bake_alira_voice --dry-run          # what is ready, what is missing
python -m backend.bake_alira_voice --only initial     # the first assessment
python -m backend.bake_alira_voice                    # everything the credits allow
```

The clips go to `frontend/public/audio/prepared/<key>.mp3`, with a readable list in `alira-voice-manifest.json`. The key covers the text, voice, model, format and delivery settings, so a clip is never reused for a different voice. The whole set is about 64,000 characters (the initial assessment is about 4,000), so recording all of it needs a paid ElevenLabs plan; the script stops when the month's credits are used and picks up where it left off next time.

A line that is not recorded is spoken live when `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is set and credits remain. If ElevenLabs refuses (no key, no credits), that line is spoken by the general OpenAI voice instead of going silent, it is not cached, and Alira's voice is tried again ten minutes later. `/api/tts/health` reports `alira_voice_everywhere` and `alira_live_voice_available`. Render's disk is temporary, so rely on recorded clips, not on the live cache, for anything a patient hears regularly.

Not covered: the live voice call (`ALIRA_REALTIME_VOICE`, an OpenAI realtime voice) and the Testing versions of Seated Forward Reach and Hand to Mouth, which keep their own private bundles described below.

## Local Chatterbox Nano (Molly)

The local seated forward-reach test and other instruction requests can use Chatterbox Nano. Keep Molly's recording and the derived 10-second WAV in `backend/voice_samples/`, which is ignored by Git. The source recording is never served as a static asset. Obtain the speaker's permission before using her voice.

The Nano API is currently in the official Chatterbox repository, not in the latest PyPI wheel. Use an isolated Python environment with CPU PyTorch, torchaudio and FFmpeg, then install the pinned source revision:

```powershell
python -m venv --system-site-packages backend/voice_samples/venv
backend/voice_samples/venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install chatterbox-tts==0.1.7
backend/voice_samples/venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps "git+https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git@5de7a54aa4e5e2baadb0182dde554908b48b85c2"
```

Set `INSTRUCTION_TTS_PROVIDER=chatterbox-nano`, `CHATTERBOX_REFERENCE_AUDIO` to the private WAV path, and `HF_HOME` to a disk with several GB free. `CHATTERBOX_FFMPEG_PATH` is optional if FFmpeg is on `PATH`. Start the backend with that environment's Python. The first voice request downloads the model; subsequent lines are cached in `backend/.local_state/tts_cache`. `/api/tts/health?purpose=instruction` should report `provider: chatterbox-nano` and `voice: Molly`.

This local setup does not change Render's voice. Its free web service does not include the private sample or the model dependencies; deployment needs a separately provisioned voice worker or private storage and enough memory. Do not commit Molly's recording or generated voice clips to public assets.

## Seated Forward Reach Testing on Render

The Testing version of Seated Forward Reach has a finite set of authored cues. Its private `/api/testing/reach/voice` endpoint serves those cues to signed-in users using either an existing configured clone provider or a prepared private bundle. It never accepts arbitrary speech text and never falls back to the preset Nova voice. If cloned audio is unavailable, the exercise continues with captions.

For a Render Free service without a voice worker, generate the clips locally with `python -m backend.build_testing_reach_voice_bundle --reference <private-molly-wav>`. Use the Chatterbox Nano environment described above, set `HF_HOME` to the disk containing the cached model, and keep the generated `backend/voice_samples/reach-molly-bundle.json` out of Git. Render limits each secret file to 500 KiB, so run `python -m backend.split_testing_reach_voice_bundle backend/voice_samples/reach-molly-bundle.json` and upload both resulting files as private secret files named `reach-molly-bundle-1.json` and `reach-molly-bundle-2.json`. Remove any oversized unsplit secret file before deploying. A restart loads both files; `/api/testing/reach/voice/health` then reports `ready: true`, `voice: Molly`, and the cue count. The original recording is never uploaded to Render for this approach.

If an ElevenLabs Molly clone is already configured on Render, the same Testing endpoint can synthesize the authored cues on demand. Verify an actual cue after configuration; a configured provider alone does not prove the voice is working.

## ElevenLabs alternative

## Create the clone

The ElevenLabs account must be on a plan that includes Instant Voice Cloning.

Use 1–2 minutes of clean, single-speaker audio with a consistent, calm instruction style. MP3 at 192 kbps or higher is preferred. Avoid music, room echo, other speakers, long silences, and aggressive noise removal.

Keep recordings in `backend/voice_samples/` or another private local folder. That repository folder is ignored by Git.

In PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = "your-key"
python backend/clone_instruction_voice.py --name "Rehyn instruction voice" --confirm-consent backend/voice_samples/my-voice.mp3
```

The command prints an ElevenLabs voice ID. Do not commit the API key or the original voice recording.

Cloned instruction audio is generated on demand and cached privately by the backend. The prepared-audio build script refuses to write cloned speech into public web assets unless a developer makes an explicit distribution decision.

## Configure Render

Set these secret environment variables on the `rehyn` service:

- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: the ElevenLabs API key
- `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`: the ID printed by the cloning command

The deployment already sets `INSTRUCTION_TTS_PROVIDER=elevenlabs`, `ELEVENLABS_TTS_MODEL=eleven_multilingual_v2`, and `ELEVENLABS_OUTPUT_FORMAT=mp3_44100_128`. Render falls back to the current OpenAI instruction voice until both secrets are present.

After Render redeploys, open `/api/tts/health?purpose=instruction`. A working clone reports `provider: elevenlabs`, `voice: custom-cloned-voice`, and `instruction_clone_ready: true` without exposing the real voice ID.
