"""Encouragement mechanism (spec section 10).

Rewards are separate from movement-quality grades: 10 per completed daily
plan, 20 per completed assessment and 2 per daily check-in. Repetitions,
individual routines and weekly rounds do not add bonus points.

Streaks include streak freezes: a day is never counted as broken when the
patient chose a rest or recovery day, reported heavy fatigue, or reported
feeling unwell in that day's check-in. All copy avoids framing illness,
fatigue, or missed sessions as failure.
